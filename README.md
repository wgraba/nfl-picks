# Purpose
Create picks for NFL confidence pool with minimum effort.

[sportsdata.io](https://sportsdata.io) is used to get stats. Calculations are
done using stats to determine winning team and confidence in terms of points.

Only ["unscrambled"](https://sportsdata.io/developers/faq#scrambled-data) 
(available in the API free trial) simple stats are used. More thoughtful 
predictions using additional stats require a subscription.

# Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* Packages in `requirements.txt`

# Usage
* Install dependent packages - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* See `python makepicks.py --help` for usage info.

A higher `Score` means a greater confidence.

# Calculations
The `Score` is determined by the thought that teams that score more
than their opponents tend to win games more often 🤔.

This is very simplistic -
* An entire season of stats (partial if currents season) is used
* Determine difference between home team points and points against
* Determine difference between away team points and points against
* Whichever potins differential is greater is the winning team
  * The `Score` is calculated by the difference of winning team's points 
    differential and the losing team's points differential

# TODO
- [x] Move to `rich` python package instead of `tabulate`
- [ ] Consider verbose logging of stats and calculations
