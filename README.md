A higher `Score` means a greater confidence.

# Calculations
The `Score` is determined by the though that teams that score more
than their opponents tend to win games more often ðŸ¤”.

This is very simplistic -
* An entire season of stats (partial if currents season) is used
* Determine difference between home team points and points against
* Determine difference between away team points and points against
* Whichever potins differential is greater is the winning team
  * The `Score` is calculated by the different of winning team's points 
    differential and the losing team's points differential

# TODO
- [ ] Move to `rich` python package instead of `tabulate`
